# multiplecopypaste README

The extension enables user to Copy Multiple values and those values can be pasteds accross the Visual Studio Code.

The Application will allow user to simultaneously copy 10 values and retain them in the memory and paste those 10 values on the editor. So it extends the features of "Ctrl + c" and "Ctrl + v" to next level so that 10 more values can be copy pasted.

In order to copy, select the test to be copied using "Ctrl + 0", "ctrl + 1" .... "ctrl + 9". Similarly the value copied on "ctrl + 1" can be pasted back to editor using "alt + 1" and so on.

## Features

Following are the features for the Extension:

1. Copy Multiple Values from the Visual Studio Editor 
2. Selected Editor Text can be copied using "Ctrl + 0", "Ctrl + 1" ... "Ctrl + 9"
3. Each value is copied at its respective index
4. Paste value at the selected index to the current Editor Curson Location
5. Value can be pasted using "Alt + 0", "Alt + 1" ... "Alt + 9"
